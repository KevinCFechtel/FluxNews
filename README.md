## Features

Flux News is still in development but implements some common features for an RSS reader. Keep in
mind that this is a personal project which is moving forward depending on my free time. At the
moment, the following is supported:

**Dark Mode:** Flux News has a material design inspired look in either light or dark themes.

**Search for articles:** Search for articles at the miniflux backend.

**Mark as read on scrollover:** Articles are marked as read when you scroll over them.

**Open articles in an app:** Articles can be opened in an already installed app.

**Order articles by date:** Articles can be ordered by date ascending or descanding.

**Filter articles by status:** Articles can be filtered by status (unread, read, starred).

**Filter articles by category:** Articles can be filtered by category.

**Filter articles by feed:** Articles can be filtered by feed.

**Send an article:** Articles can be send to third-party services if enabled.

**Truncate an article:** Articles can be truncated to have a teaser instead of the full article text.
